I am a current graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a PhD in astronomy. I'm interested in black holes, active galactic nuclei, and anything having to so with compact objects or gravity (as well as particle physics, quantum mechanics, machine learning, etc). Basically, if it's something you've heard in a sci-fi movie, I'm probably interested in it.
