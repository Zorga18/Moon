I am a current graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a PhD in astronomy. I'm interested in black holes, active galactic nuclei, and anything having to so with compact objects or gravity (as well as particle physics, quantum mechanics, machine learning, etc). Basically, if it's something you've heard in a sci-fi movie, I'm probably interested in it. 


I'm also into listening to music (what a vague statement, I know). More specifically, I listen to classic rock, hard rock, and a little bit of early metal from the 80's - 90's. I also used to listen to some EDM, but from around 2014 so I'm clueless as to what has come out afterwards. Here is a list of some of the artists I usually listen to:

* The Beatles
* The Rolling Stones
* Steely Dan
* Van Halen
* Aerosmith
* Deep Purple
* AC/DC
* Def Leppard
* ELO
* Led Zepplin
* Pink Floyd
* Rush
* Lynyrd Skynyrd
* Black Sabbath
* Metallica
* Kiss
* Judas Priest
* Motorhead
* Iron Maiden
* Billy Squier
* The Who
* Jimi Hendrix
* The Doors
* Motley Crue
* Nirvana
* Foo Fighters
* Red Hot Chili Peppers
* Steve Miller Band
* CCR
* Queen
* Foreigner
* Yes
* ZZ Top
* Ozzy Osbourne
* Green Day
* Rage Against the Machine

Strangely, I also enjoy listening to some of the more typical or 80s-ish music from the 80's. This includes:

* Oingo Boingo
* Devo
* Billy Idol
* Genesis
* Don Henley

and probably anything else you could think of.
