## Introduction

The Condor Array Telescope is an array of six refracting telescopes built for the purpose of imaging low surface brightness objects in the Universe. In many cases, reflecting telescopes are much more useful in terms of practicality and viewing potential. They allow for very large apertures with no cost to the size of the telescope, due to the addition of various mirrors inside of the telescope. However, these mirrors interior to the telescope allow for more refraction and therefore intrinsic noise in the images taken. The mirrors inside of the telescope will allow for additional refraction, meaning less of a focus on the image. In most cases, there is enough light coming from the source one is looking at to consider this effect negligible. However, as the photons received from an object become scarce, this effect becomes more important and introducea a large amount of uncertainty. Therefore, to measure low surface brightness objects, one needs to use refracting telescopes to limit the extra scattering of light introduced in reflecting telescopes.

However, these refracting telescopes are limited by the size of the focusing lens. If the lens is too large, the telescope cannot support it. Therefore, in order to have a large effective focus and diameter, one can use an array of refracting telescopes. This is is the theory behind the creation of the Condor Array Telescope. Though there are others that have created such telescope arrays (see [Abraham & van Dokkum 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126...55A/abstract)), the Condor Array Telescope utilizes off-the-shelf CMOS cameras, as opposed to the often-used CCD cameras. CMOS cameras have an advantage over CCD cameras not only in the way they take images, but also at the rate they do so, and the level of noise they can reach. CMOS cameras have the ability of taking images at a 60 second cadence, almost unheard of in astronomy due to the read-time of CCD cameras. CMOS cameras have very efficient read-times, allowing for very rapid cadences. This allows for the Condor Array Telescope to take exposures of low surface brightness objects at a very rapid cadence, which has only recently been able to be done. More details of the status of the telescope, instrumentation involved, and research goals can be found at the [official website](https://condorarraytelescope.org), headed by Professor Kenneth Lanzetta at Stony Brook University.

## Modeling the PSF

Seeing as the Condor Array Telescope is focused on low surface brightness objects, the scattering of light becomes very important, as evidenced by the use of refracting telescopes. However, the telescope is not the only source of scattered light in the images we wish to obtain. There is also light scattered in the atmosphere from sources near the objects we wish to observe. These could be bright stars near an ultra-diffuse galaxy, or even the Moon near a molecular cloud in the IGM. Seeing as the photons from these dim sources are scarce, they can be influenced by these bright objects in an influential way, even if these sources are far away from the objects. Thus, we need to be able to account for this scattered light off of the bright objects in order to properly analyze the dimmer ones.

The scattered light from a point source is goverened by the **point spread function** also known as the PSF. The measurement of the PSF is integral to accounting for the effect of scattered ligght near low surface brightness objects. In our case, the PSF can effect sources at large distances from the center of the object as well. Therefore, it is important **not only** to measure the "core" (inner part) of the PSF, but also its "wings" (outer parts). We define the PSF as either a function of radius or angle (both mean the same thing, it is only a matter of convention what you wish to label it). Thus, we need to measure and model the PSF out to large $$\theta$$ to be able to properly observe low surface brightness objects.

To do this, we developed an algorithm to measure and model the PSF of an arbitrary image, given the locations and fluxes of the stars in the image. This invoves using the normal equations ($$\bf{A} \vec{x} = \vec{b}$$) to minimize chi-squared of an entire image. This is done across the entire image to minimize chi-squared in general and model the PSF. However, to reduce computation of the design matrix $$\bf{A}$$, pixels are grouped on the grid of the input image to create a different set of "pixels" on a masked model grid. Furthermore, the sampling of the PSF for each star can be reduced so that each star is only sampleed until its light is scattered to below the noise level. This allows for very quick computation of a model PSF for an arbitrary image. Additionally, we are obtaining the positions and fluxes through the use of [astrometry.net](https://astrometry.net) (see [Dustin et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....139.1782L/abstract)). This involves using Numpy, Scipy, and Astropy in Python to construct and solve the design matrix of each image.

Initially, we created simulated images using certain Fourier transform and convolution methods in Python. We then began to use actual data from certain databases (Gaia, MAST, etc.). These images were made using the PSF measured from the Dragonfly Telephoto Array as an estimate, though we are now beginning to receive data from the Condor Array Telescope and get observations.
