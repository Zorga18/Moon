After a long (and great) four years at Stony Brook University, I've finally graduated summa cum laude with two Bachelor's in Science (Astronomy/Planetary Science and Physics), as well as a minor in math. I'm very proud of all of the work I've put in, all of the skils I've developed (personally and professionally), and all of the results I've gotten out of it. Going to University was my first step into adulthood: my first time living away from home, my first time challenging myself academically, my first time doing research, my first time truly finding a passion, and my first time finding likeminded people. I want to thank all of the people who brought me this far, including the faculty at SBU, my research advisors, my friends, and most importantly my family.

That being said, I've decided to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to pursue a Ph.D. in Astronomy! Out of all of the graduate programs I'd applied to, the one at UIUC was the friendliest, most inclusive, and the one I think could grant me the most opportunities and the most development. I want to continue learning about astrophysics and developing my interests. At the moment, my interests are scattered, as I enjoy studying black holes, neutron stars, relativity, AGN, compact binaries, gravitational waves relativity... the list goes on and on. However, whatever I end up choosing, I'm sure the faculty and other graduate students at UIUC will help me along the way. Here's to the next however many years in Illinois!
