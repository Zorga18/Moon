## Exoplanets
### Professor: Philip Armitage

In the Spring of 2020, I had taken a class called "Exoplanets", focused on giving an overview of exoplanets, their motions, compositions, formation, and observations. There were two major projects done throughout this course: one was a paper investigating a problem for exoplanets, and the other was a numerical simulation. My [research paper](/files/AST390Midterm.pdf) was focused on the hot jupiter inflation problem, and talked about its history and a variety of solutions that had been proposed over the years. For the [simulation](/files/AST390Final.pdf), I had used a Python-wrapped version of the planetary system simulator "rebound". This allows for the simulation of a variety of n-body scenarios, including planetary systems, protoplanetary disks, and the current solar system. I used rebound to model the solar system with the proposed "Planet X", and observe how it would affect the stability of the solar system over millions of years. Depending on the initial conditions of the orbit and characteristics of Planet X, even larger bodies such as Pluto and Neptune could have their orbits influenced siginificantly, sometimes ejecting Pluto from the solar system.
