# Involvement: August 2017 - May 2021

## Exoplanets
### Professor: Philip Armitage

In the Spring of 2020, I had taken a class called "Exoplanets", focused on giving an overview of exoplanets, their motions, compositions, formation, and observations. There were two major projects done throughout this course: one was a paper investigating a problem for exoplanets, and the other was a numerical simulation. My [research paper](/files/AST%20390%20Midterm.pdf) was focused on the hot jupiter inflation problem, and talked about its history and a variety of solutions that had been proposed over the years. For the [simulation](/files/AST390Final.pdf), I had used a Python-wrapped version of the planetary system simulator "rebound". This allows for the simulation of a variety of n-body scenarios, including planetary systems, protoplanetary disks, and the current solar system. I used rebound to model the solar system with the proposed "Planet X", and observe how it would affect the stability of the solar system over millions of years. Depending on the initial conditions of the orbit and characteristics of Planet X, even larger bodies such as Pluto and Neptune could have their orbits influenced siginificantly, sometimes ejecting Pluto from the solar system.

## Astronomy Lab
### Professor: Fred Walter

In the Fall of 2021, I enrolled in an undergraduate astronomy lab, designed to teach techniques of observational astronomy in all wavelengths and types of messengers. This course was composed of multiple core projects: a mock proposal for the Hubble Space Telescope, observing with the Mt. Stony Brook Observatory and presenting the obtained data, analyzing archived data, and presenting a poster of results. For the [mock HST proposal](/files/HSTProp.pdf), I proposed to observe the binary black hole candidate and AGN OJ 287 spectroscopically, in order to observe changes in composition and motion of material within the object. Using the Observatory at Mt. Stony Brook, I, along with other students, attempted to observe the exoplanet system surrounding Kepler-20 over the course of several weeks. I had [presented the data](/files/AST443%20Poster.pptx) and analyzed it properly (bias-subtracting, flat-fielding, photometrically calibrating, etc), though the data was insufficient to show a transit of any exoplanet. More successfully, I [analyzed spectroscopic data of the blazar BL Lacertae](/files/AST443Paper.pdf) from the National Extragalactic Database (NED). This was particularly challenging seeing as BL Lac is a blazar, and therefore its spectrum ais more or less featureless and its spectral lines are severely Doppler broadened. However, using fitting and analysis methods in Python, as well as using spectral line databases such as NIST, I was able to make inferences about material within BL Lac and its implications. This analysis was then used for a [presentation](/files/AST443ArchivalPresentation.pptx) for the final project.

## Compact Objects
### Professor: James Lattimer

In Spring of 2021, I took an undergraduate course called "Compact Objects in General Relativity". This was an overview of compact objects with a basis in undergraduate general relativity theory. This involved analyzing polytropes in GR, deriving the maximum/minimum mass of a neutron star, working in Kerr spacetimes, deriving the tidal deformability of neutron stars, analyzing dense nuclear theory, and deriving gravitational waves from compact binary mergers. Along with the material taught, there were also two papers assigned for the class, focused on any topic related to compact objects in general. The [first paper](/files/Report1.pdf) I had written was an overview of the (at the present moment) most massive binary black hole merger GW190521 and its various implications. These implications stem from the scenarios that would foster this merger, including hierarchical merging, binary black holes in active galactic nuclei, black hole mergers in globular clusters, etc. The [second paper](/files/Report2.pdf) I had written was an overview of pulsar timing arrays and pulsar timing in general. I explain the different times of timing residuals analyzed, and what they can tell us, especially about gravitational waves and compact objects. This includes the limits set on the gravitational wave bacjground, thought to be composed of an incoherent superposition of supermassive black hole binaries, or cosmic strings and dark matter.
